# Something in the Shadows

This app was made in Red Badge as a final group project. We decided to create an app about haunted places and stories in Indiana. All three of us have an interest in the paranormal/love to listen to scary stories. Angular 7 was used on the client side and Node.js was used on the server side. We incorporated Angular Material and the Google Maps API into our project. The goals we set for ourselves were accomplished. We went above and beyond our minimum viable product and met our stretch goals (Google Maps API for example). The output of this app exceeded our expectations and we are incredibly happy with it!
